## The Reform Party Constitution

### People centric democracy

People should be the beating heart of any democracy.
    Politicians are servants to the people they serve making personal sacrifices for the good of their country and the betterment of mankind.
     Our goal is to show that there is an alternative to electing mediocre politicians. Our goal is to show the people the power they truly wield.
    Democracy belongs to the people, it is time we learnt how to use it.

### Accountability breeds openness

Lies and mistrust breed lies and mistrust. We believe the public has the power to break that cycle.
    By having a comprehensive set of checks and balances and a fair, proportional and decisive, independently determined sanction and penalty system.

A fair and accountable government would protect and promote the decent hard working politicians,
    while working to expose and expel those who do not have the public interest at heart.

An accountable government would allow us all to know that politicians were working for their constituents and for their country at large.

### Open government delivers a better society.

An accountable government would be much less likely to put the interests of business ahead of the public good.
    Promoting more focus on delivering lean private contracts that provide better public service for less cost. Reducing public debt,
    improving the economy and having a positive impact the standard of living.

### Political Engagement

The public's perception of MPs has never been lower, they are constantly seen by the public at large as self-serving,
     dishonest and out of touch with the public at large.

We believe that a much simplified expenses system, based on our current tax system, would make the public much less critical.
     Giving local government responsibility over providing MPs with constituency offices and staff would remove any allegations of nepotism and cronyism.
     Having a wage system that is directly linked to the national average wage would prove to the people that raising the standard of living was in everybody's interest.

### Decoupling money from politics.

Influencing government officials is big business. From pressure groups to lobbyists there are a lot of people,
    and a lot of money put into changing the way a politician votes.

Whether it is directly through a politician, or via a party we do not believe that money should influence government,
    at any level. We believe that this can be combated by taking a tough stance on lobbying in all forms.
    By setting up a mandatory register of lobbyists, and for all lobbying activity to be reported by both the lobbyist and any involved politician.
    This would give the public instant feedback of where and how political pressure is being applied to government.

We would also like to see campaign spending limited, we don't believe it is possible to raise hundreds of millions in campaign
    contributions without their being some patronage expected in return. We want to see centrally collected, immediately reported
     campaign funding. With donor details kept for any donation over a nominal sum.

### Grassroots politics

Democracy works best when it is served by a wide cross section of the population.
    When the majority of the cabinet has a similar background then the scope for political discourse will be stunted.

We believe that we should strive to teach politics from the earliest ages, to instill a sense of pride and responsibility in politics.
     Give our young a place to aspire towards. A chance to serve their community, their country and the world.

We should show our children what is possible when our leaders are noble, ethical and Most Honourable Ladies and Gentlemen.

We believe that is the beauty of politics, and we should all expect better, demand better and elect a better standard of political system and candidate.
