## The Reform Party Constitution

### Background
Public perception of government is that it is broken. People have little confidence in their elected officials. They believe they only serve their own interests and the interests of big businesses and the elite. They feel that politicians have no understanding of the day to day lives of ordinary people.

**The Reform Party** believes that the majority of politicians are hard working and dedicated to serving their constituents and the country at large. However there are a minority of bad politicians who are using their power to further their own goals and interests. It is these that have tarnished and corrupted the image of politics in the United Kingdom.

**The Reform Party** plans to pursue the implementation of a small number of measures to expose and purge that minority.

### Aligned only to a *Fair and Open Government*
**The Reform Party** is neither a left nor a right wing party. We believe that a Fair and Open Government should be put above all party allegiances. For this reason **The Reform Party** will only have policies on matters relating to improving the integrity of Government.

### Simple, Effective Solutions
**The Reform Party** will only put forward solutions to clearly defined problems. The proposed solutions will be straightforward and understandable.

### Ethics, Integrity, Openness
**The Reform Party** will be the flag barer for good faith politics.
